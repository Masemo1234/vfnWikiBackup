<p>The handiwork of the gods is everywhere - in places of natural beauty, in mighty crusades, in soaring temples, and in the hearts of
worshipers. Like people, gods run the gamut from benevolent to malicious, reserved to intrusive, simple to inscrutable. The gods, however, work
mostly through intermediaries - their clerics. Good clerics heal, protect, and avenge. Evil clerics pillage, destroy, and sabotage. A cleric uses
the power of his god to make his god's will manifest. And if a cleric uses his god's power to improve his own lot, that's to be
expected, too.</p>
<p>Ideally, a cleric's adventures support his god's causes, at least in a general way. A good cleric, for example, helps those in need.
If, through noble acts, he can improve the reputation to his god or temple, that's even better. An evil cleric seeks to increase his own power
and that of his deity, so that others will respect and fear both.</p>
<p>Clerics sometimes receive orders, or at least suggestions, from their ecclesiastical superiors, directing them to undertake missions for the
church. The clerics and their companions are compensated fairly for these missions, and the church may be especially generous with the casting of
needed spells or divine magic items as payment. Of course, clerics are people, too, and they may have any or all the more common motivations for
adventuring.</p>
<p>Clerics are masters of divine magic, which is especially good at healing. Even an inexperienced cleric can bring people back from the brink of
death, and an experienced cleric can bring back people who have crossed over that brink. As channelers of divine energy, clerics can affect undead
creatures. A good cleric can turn away or even destroy undead; an evil cleric can bring undead under his control. Clerics have some combat training.
They can use simple weapons, and they are trained in the use of armor, since armor does not interfere with divine spells the way it does with arcane
spells.</p>
<p>Alignment: Like the gods they serve, clerics can be of any alignment. Because people more readily worship good deities than neutral or evil ones,
there are more good than evil clerics. Clerics also tend toward law instead of chaos, since lawful religions tend to be more structured and better
able to recruit and train clerics than chaotic ones.</p>
<p>Typically, a cleric is the same alignment as his deity, though some clerics are one step away from their respective deities in alignment. For
example, most clerics of Heironeous, the god of valor (who is lawful good) are lawful good, but some are lawful neutral or neutral good.
Additionally, a cleric may not be neutral (that is, neutral on both the good-evil axis and the lawful-chaotic axis) unless his deity is
neutral.</p>
<p>Every reasonably well-known deity has clerics devoted to him or her, so clerics can be of any religion. The deity most common worshiped by human
clerics in civilized lands is Pelor (god of the sun). The majority of nonhuman clerics are devoted to the chief god of the appropriate racial
pantheon. Most clerics are officially ordained members of religious organizations, commonly called churches. Each has sworn to uphold the ideals of
his church. Some clerics devote themselves not to a god but to a cause or a source of divine power. These characters wield magic the way clerics
devoted to individual gods do, but they are not associated with any religious institution or any particular practice of worship. A cleric devoted to
good and law, for example, may be on friendly terms with the clerics of lawful and good deities and may extol the virtues of a good and lawful life,
but he is not a functionary in a church hierarchy.</p>
<p>Most clerics join their churches as young adults, though some are devoted to a god's service from a young age, and a few feel the call later
in life. While some clerics are tightly bound to their churches' activities on a daily basis, others have more freedom to conduct their lives
as they please, as long as they do so in accordance with their gods' wishes.</p>
<p>Clerics of a given religion are all supposed to get along, though schisms within a church are often more bitter than conflicts between religions.
Clerics who share some basic ideals, such as goodness or lawfulness, may find common cause with each other and see themselves as part of an order or
body that supersedes any given religion. Clerics of opposed goals, however, are sworn enemies. In civilized lands, open warfare between religions
occurs only during civil wars and similar social upheavals, but vicious politicking between opposed churches is common.</p>
<p>All the common races are represented in this class, since the need for religion and divine magic is universal. The clerics of most races, however,
are too focused on their religious duties to undertake an adventurer's life. Crusading, adventuring clerics most often come from the human and
dwarf races. Among the savage humanoids, clerics are less common. The exception is troglodytes, who take well to divine magic and are often led by
priests, who make a practice of sacrificing and devouring captives.</p>
<p>In an adventuring party, the cleric is everybody's friend and often the glue that holds the party together. As the one who can channel
divine energy, a cleric is a capable healer, and adventurers of every class appreciate being put back together after they've taken some hard
knocks. Clerics sometimes clash with druids, since druids represent an older, more primal relationship between the mortal and the divine. Mostly,
though, the religion of a cleric determines how he gets along with others. A cleric of Olidammara (god of thieves), gets along fine with rogues and
ne'er-do-wells, for example, while a cleric of Heironeous (god of valor) rankles at such company.</p>
<p>The cleric serves as a typical group's primary healer, diviner, and defensive specialist. He can hold his own in a fight but usually
isn't well served by charging to the front of combat. The cleric's domains and spell selection can greatly affect his role as well.</p>

<h6><a id="cleric-class-features" name="cleric-class-features"></a>Class Features</h6>
<p class="initial">All of the following are class features of the cleric.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with
shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p>A cleric who chooses the <a href="../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/domains.html#war" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">War</a> domain receives the <a href="../../feats/featsAll.html#weapon-focus" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Weapon Focus</a> feat related to his deity's weapon as a bonus feat. He also
receives the appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category.</p>
<p><a id="cleric-aura" name="cleric-aura"></a><b>Aura (Ex)</b>: A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura
corresponding to the deity's alignment (see the detect evil spell for details). Clerics who don't worship a specific deity but choose the
Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain have a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.</p>
<p><a id="cleric-spells" name="cleric-spells"></a><b>Spells</b>: A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/clericSpells.html">cleric spell list</a>. However, his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical
beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw
against a cleric's spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on
Table: The Cleric. In addition, he receives <a href="../../basic/basics.html#table-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells">bonus spells</a> per
day if he has a high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell
level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see
Deities, Domains, and Domain Spells, below).</p>
<p>Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or
supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare
and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his
daily meditation.</p>
<p><b>Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells</b>: A cleric's deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others
see him. A cleric chooses two <a style="color: #579eb6" href="../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/domains.html">domains</a> from among those belonging to his deity. A cleric can
select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain.</p>
<p>If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two domains to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities. The
restriction on alignment domains still applies.</p>
<p>Each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. The cleric gets
the granted powers of both the domains selected. With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day
in his domain spell slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell slot.</p>
<p><b>Spontaneous Casting</b>: A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the
cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can "lose" any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any cure spell
of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).</p>
<p>An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), can't convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells
(an inflict spell is one with "inflict" in its name).</p>
<p>A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells
(player's choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or commands
undead (see below).</p>
<p><a id="cleric-chaotic-evil-good-and-lawful-spells" name="cleric-chaotic-evil-good-and-lawful-spells"></a><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful
Spells</b>: A cleric can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity's (if he has one). Spells associated with
particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
<p><a id="cleric-turn-or-rebuke-undead" name="cleric-turn-or-rebuke-undead"></a><b>Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su)</b>: Any cleric, regardless of
alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke
Undead).</p>
<p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who
worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether his turning ability
functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the
cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see above).</p>
<p>A cleric may attempt to <a href="../../basic/specialAttacks.html#turn" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">turn undead</a> a number of times per day equal to 3
+ his Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.</p>
<p><a id="cleric-bonus-languages" name="cleric-bonus-languages"></a><b>Bonus Languages</b>: A cleric's bonus language options include
Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the
bonus languages available to the character because of his race.</p>
<h6><a id="ex-clerics" name="ex-clerics"></a>Ex-Clerics</h6>
<p class="initial">A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells and class features, except for armor and
shield proficiencies and proficiency with simple weapons. He cannot thereafter gain levels as a cleric of that god until he atones (see the atonement
spell description).</p>

<h4>Ancestral Speaker</h4>
<p>Many cultures, both primitive and surprisingly advanced, give
their religious devotion not to deities (or at least not
solely to deities), but to the spirits of their departed
ancestors. An ancestral speaker calls upon his forebears, and
the deceased patriarchs and matriarchs of his clan, family, or
nation, for spells and guidance. Unlike standard clerics,
whose first devotion is often to their priesthood, an
ancestral speaker serves and protects the honor of his
ancestors and the well-being of his people with equal fervor.
They are, after all, essentially the same thing; his people
today are the family of those who have gone, and they
themselves will one day be the ancestor spirits to following
generations.</p>
<p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>
<h5>Class Skills</h5>
<p>The ancestral speaker's class skills (and the key ability for
each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy
(Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local)
(Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perform (Cha), Profession
(Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). Further, an
ancestral speaker may choose any two cross-class skills to
become class skills; these were taught to him by his ancestors
during communion over the course of his training to become an
ancestral speaker.</p>

<h5>Class Features</h5>
<p>All of the following are class features of the ancestral speaker.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: The ancestral speaker is
proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium
armor, and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><b>Ancestral Communion (Ex)</b>: In addition to spells, the ancestral
speaker may pray to his ancestors for advice or knowledge.
At 1st level, the ancestral speaker may request a bonus on any
one specific skill, once per day. The ancestors grant him
temporary knowledge of that skill, bestowing a competence
bonus equal to the ancestral speaker's Charisma modifier plus
his class level. It does not matter if the speaker already
possesses any ranks in this skill or not; the ancestral
speaker can use the skill even if he is untrained in its use
or cannot normally use it. The bonus lasts for a number of
rounds equal to 1 plus the ancestral speaker's Charisma bonus.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the ancestral
speaker may use this power an additional time per day.</p>
<p>At 9th level, the ancestral speaker may choose to ask the
ancestors' advice, rather than seeking their aid with skills.
Instead of a skill bonus, he may choose to ask them questions,
as per the commune spell cast by a cleric of his level. He may
do this only once per day; any other uses of ancestral
communion during that day must be requests for help with a
skill.</p>
<p><b>Holy Presence (Ex)</b>: The ancestral speaker is considered to be
his own holy symbol, as he is descended from the beings on
whom he calls. Thus, he need not carry any such symbol, and
can cast spells with the Divine Focus component without one.</p>
<p><b>Death Talker (Ex)</b>: Due to his long association with the
spirits of the departed, the 4th-level ancestral speaker gains
a +2 bonus to all Diplomacy, Bluff, Intimidate, and Sense
Motive checks against undead. At 8th level and every 4 levels
thereafter, this bonus increases by +2.</p>
<p><b>Improved Resurrection (Ex)</b>: The ancestors on whom the speaker
calls well know the pathways between life and death, and they
can smooth over the transition for anyone making the crossing
at their speaker's behest. Anyone raised or resurrected by an
ancestral speaker still loses a level, but only a portion of
the normal XP. Under most conditions, level loss drops the
victim to the halfway point of the old level; someone raised
by an ancestral speaker drops to the three-quarter mark. For
example, a 9th-level character who is raised would normally
drop to 32,000 XP. (A character needs 28,000 for 8th level and
36,000 for 9th, so half the difference is 4,000.) If that
character was raised by a speaker, however, he would drop only
to 34,000 XP.</p>
<a id="arcane-disciple" name="arcane-disciple"></a>
<h4>Arcane Disciple</h4>
<p>Many worlds have gods of magic and clerics who worship them.
Some clerics, however, give their devotion not to any deity of
magic but to the concept and forces of magic itself. They
believe that magic represents the fundamental power underlying
all reality and worship it as a force higher than any god.
These arcane disciples believe that all magic is inherently
linked, although they have only managed to cross the boundary
between arcane and divine in minor fashion. Many arcane
disciples multiclass as wizards and go on to obtain the mystic
theurge prestige class.</p>
<p><b>Hit Die</b>: d6.</p>
<h5>Class Skills</h5>
<p>The arcane disciple's class skills (and the key ability for
each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher
Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcana)
(Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int),
Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft
(Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
<p><b>Skill Points at 1st Level</b>: (4 + Int modifier) &times; 4.</p>
<p><b>Skill Points at Each Additional Level</b>: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

<h5>Class Features</h5>
<p>All of the following are class features of the arcane disciple.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: The arcane disciple is
proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium
armor, and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><b>Arcane to Divine (Ex)</b>: At every level, the arcane disciple may
choose one arcane spell from either the bard or sorcerer/wizard
spell list. This spell must be at least one level lower than
the highest-level divine spell the character may cast. The
arcane disciple may then add this spell to her normal clerical
spell list, and forever after may cast it as a divine spell
like any other. Furthermore, while the arcane disciple does
not technically possess the <a href="../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/domains.html#magic">Magic domain</a> (as she has no
domains to choose from), all the spells of the Magic domain
are considered divine spells for the arcane disciple, and are
added to her cleric spell list in addition to any arcane
spells she chooses as she advances in level.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: At 1st level, at 5th level, and every five levels
thereafter, the arcane disciple gains a bonus feat. These
feats must be either metamagic or item creation feats.</p>
<a id="aspirant" name="aspirant"></a>
<h4>Aspirant</h4>
<p>Among some religious orders, the goal of the initiates is not
to serve the gods but to become like them. Some cultures
believe divine ascension is possible - that mortals can rise
to take a seat beside the gods themselves. Others maintain
that mortals cannot become divinities but that they might yet
serve the gods on a higher plane as saints or proxies. Still
others believe that even if they never achieve true ascension
through their endeavors, their efforts to imitate the divine
raise them above their fellow mortals.</p>
<p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>
<h5>Class Skills</h5>
<p>The aspirant's class skills (and the key ability for each
skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha),
Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history)
(Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes)
(Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
<p><b>Skill Points at 1st Level</b>: (4 + Int modifier) &times; 4.</p>

<h5>Class Features</h5>
<p>All of the following are class features of the aspirant.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: The aspirant is proficient with
all simple weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields
(except tower shields).</p>
<p><b>Spontaneous Casting</b>: At 1st level, the aspirant gains the
ability to lose any prepared clerical spell for any other
clerical spell of equal or lower level, but only once per
day. She may cast a spontaneous spell twice per day at 4th
level, three times per day at 8th, four times per day at 12th,
and five times per day at 16th level. This represents the
aspirant's growing ability to manipulate divine energies
directly.</p>
<p><b>Shield of the Divine (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, the aspirant gains a
+1 bonus to AC. At 5th level and every five levels thereafter,
the bonus increases by +1. This bonus applies even when the
aspirant is flat-footed or helpless.</p>
<p><b>Divine Counterspell (Sp)</b>: An aspirant of 3rd-level or higher
may counter a divine spell cast by another spellcaster without
expending a spell for the day. The aspirant must be high
enough level to cast a spell of the same level as the spell
she wishes to counter. To do so, an aspirant must ready an
action to counterspell as normal, but the aspirant need not
determine what the spell is. If the spell cast is not a divine
spell, the aspirant cannot counter it, but she does not waste
her use of this ability, only her action. The aspirant can use
this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her
Charisma modifier.</p>
<p><b>Perfect Self</b>: At 20th level, the aspirant has become so fully
connected with the power of the divine that she becomes a
magical creature. This ability has the same effect as the monk
ability of the same name.</p>
<a id="azurin-cleric" name="azurin-cleric"></a>
<img src="../../resource/images/classes/vMoIazurincleric.jpg" class="wrap" />
<h4>Azurin Cleric</h4>
<p>An azurin cleric dedicates herself not only to a deity or
pantheon, but also to the power of incarnum. Just as most
azurins cleave to polarized alignments, azurin clerics take
extreme positions on morals and ethics. Azurin clerics prefer
to battle foes opposed to their alignment, and work best with
other incarnum-wielding characters.</p>
<p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>
<h5>Requirements</h5>
<p>To take an azurin cleric substitution level, a character
must be an azurin about to take her 1st, 4th, or 9th level
of cleric.</p>
<h5>Class Skills</h5>
<p>Azurin cleric substitution levels grant the same class skills as
the standard cleric class, plus Knowledge (the planes).</p>
<p><b>Skill Points at Each Level</b>: 2 + Int modifier (or four times
this number as a beginning character).</p>
<h5>Class Features</h5>
<p>All of the following are features of the azurin cleric racial
substitution levels.</p>
<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells</b>: An azurin cleric
who selects any azurin cleric substitution level loses the
ability to cast any spells of an alignment that doesn't match
her own. For example, a chaotic good azurin cleric can't cast
evil or lawful spells.</p>
<p>This restriction replaces the standard cleric restriction
regarding what alignment of spells the cleric
can cast.</p>
<p><b>Channel Incarnum (Su)</b>: An azurin cleric
channels incarnum rather than mere positive or
negative energy. Once per round as a free
action, an azurin cleric can grant herself
bonus essentia equal to her Charisma
bonus or one-half her cleric level
(whichever is lower), minimum
1. This essentia lasts for
1 round.</p>
<p>The character can use this
ability a number of times per
day equal to 3 + her Charisma
modifier.</p>
<p>This benefit replaces a standard cleric's
ability to turn or rebuke undead gained
at 1st level. An azurin cleric can use
this ability in place of turn or rebuke
undead to qualify for any divine feat,
and can spend daily uses of this feat
to power divine feats as if they were
daily uses of turn or rebuke undead
(though doing so requires a standard
action rather than a free action unless
the feat states otherwise).</p>
<p><b>Soultouched Weapon (Su)</b>: Beginning
at 4th level, an azurin cleric can
use incarnum to imbue her weapon
with the power of her soul's convictions.
This requires a move
action and grants a single held
melee weapon an alignment for
the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction. The alignment
chosen must be part of
the azurin cleric's alignment;
for example, a chaotic good
azurin cleric could choose to
make her weapon chaotic or good, but
not lawful or evil. A neutral azurin
cleric gains no benefit from this
class feature.</p>
<p>While this ability is in effect, an
azurin cleric can also invest essentia
in the affected weapon. The weapon
gains an insight bonus equal to the
invested essentia on damage rolls against creatures whose
alignment includes a component opposed to the chosen
alignment. For example, a good weapon would deal an extra
1 point of damage per point of invested essentia against
evil creatures (whether lawful evil, neutral evil, or
chaotic evil).</p>
<p>The effects of this ability last for a number of
rounds equal to 3 + one-half her class level. An
azurin cleric can use this ability a number of times
per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>This benefit replaces the 2nd-level spell slot
gained by a standard cleric at 4th level. From this
point forward, the number of 2nd-level spell slots possessed
by an azurin cleric is reduced by one.</p>
<p><b>Distribute Incarnum (Su)</b>: A 9th-level azurin cleric
can enhance the essentia pools of nearby allies by
distributing free-flowing incarnum in the environment.
This requires the cleric to sacrifice
a cleric spell of 5th level or higher (a
standard action that does not provoke
attacks of opportunity) and grants
all allies (including herself) within
30 feet bonus essentia equal to the
spell's level. All affected characters
can immediately invest this
essentia without spending an action
(though currently invested
essentia may not be shifted). The
essentia lasts until the end of the
cleric's next turn.</p>
<p>If an ally has no essentia pool, she can
instead choose to heal 1 hp of damage per point
of essentia that would be granted. This applies
equally to all living and undead creatures, regardless
of whether the cleric would normally spontaneously
cast cure or inflict spells.</p>
<p>This benefit replaces a standard
cleric's ability to spontaneously cast
cure or inflict spells of 5th level
and above.</p>

<a id="benevolent" name="benevolent"></a>
<h4>Benevolent</h4>
<p>In many cultures, the primary function of the cleric is to
bless the undertakings of others, to grant the gods' favor on
those who labor in their name. The benevolent exemplifies this
role. A benevolent is devoted to aiding and abetting others in
their times of need and to increasing the good fortune of his
allies. The benevolent is as capable in combat as any
cleric - otherwise he could not accompany soldiers on the
battlefield - but his focus is on their needs, not his own.
The vast majority of benevolents are good-aligned, although
evil ones are not unheard of.</p>
<p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>
<h5>Class Skills</h5>
<p>The benevolent's class skills (and the key ability for each
skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha),
Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history)
(Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes)
(Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
<p><b>Skill Points at 1st Level</b>: (4 + Int modifier) &times; 4.</p>
<p><b>Skill Points at Each Additional Level</b>: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

<p><b>Spontaneous Casting (Ex)</b>: The benevolent has a wider range of
spontaneous spells than the standard cleric, although they are
all geared toward aiding others. The benevolent may lose any
prepared spell of equal or higher level in exchange for any of
the following spells:</p>
<p><i>0</i> - cure minor wounds, guidance, resistance;</p>
<p><i>1st</i> - bless, cure light wounds, sanctuary;</p>

<p><i>5th</i> - atonement, mass cure light wounds;</p>
<p><i>6th</i> - mass cure moderate wounds, heal;</p>
<p><i>7th</i> - greater restoration, mass cure serious wounds;</p>
<p><i>8th</i> - mass cure critical wounds;</p>
<p><i>9th</i> - mass heal.</p>
<p><b>Luck of the Gods (Sp)</b>: Starting at 4th level, the benevolent
can, with a brief benediction, bestow good fortune upon
others. The recipient of this prayer may, any time within the
next 24 hours, reroll any single die roll, as per the granted
power for the Luck Domain. If the blessing is not used within
24 hours, it is lost. Additionally, the recipient may add a
luck bonus equal to the benevolent's Charisma bonus to any
single roll during that 24-hour period. These two effects can
be applied to the same roll. The benevolent may not use this
power on himself, and he may use it only upon someone within
one alignment step of his deity. Multiple applications of luck
of the gods do not stack. This power may be used once per day
at 4th level, twice per day at 8th level, three times per day
at 12th level, four times per day at 16th level, and five
times per day at 20th level.</p>
<a id="blasphemous-incantation" name="blasphemous-incantation"></a>
<h4>Blasphemous Incantation</h4>
<p>Not all evil deities or fiendish
powers are concerned
with undead. Some grant their
mortal servants the ability to channel their
unholy will in the form of a blasphemous
incantation.</p>
<p><b>Class</b>: Cleric.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st (cleric).</p>
<p><b>Special Requirement</b>: To select this class feature, you
must be evil. If your alignment changes to something other
than evil, you lose access to this class feature until your
alignment is restored to evil.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: If you select this alternative class feature, you
lose the ability to rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You can call upon your evil master to smite your
enemies. All good creatures within 30 feet must succeed on
Fortitude saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha
modifier) or become sickened for a number of rounds equal
to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round).</p>
<p>You can utter a blasphemous incantation a number of times
per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier. If you have 5 or more
ranks in Knowledge (religion), the DC of the Fortitude save
increases by 2.</p>
<p>Blasphemous incantation is a supernatural ability.
<h4><a id="champion" name="champion"></a>Champion</h4>
<p>Some clerics prefer to be champions of good (or evil), standing at the
forefront of the battle against the enemy.</p>
<p>This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features
for one or more class features of another class. A class feature
gained works just as it did for its original class, including the
level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as
noted below.</p>
<p><b>Lose</b>: Turn undead.</p>
<p><b>Gain</b>: Smite evil, if the cleric would normally channel positive energy,
or smite good, if the cleric would normally channel negative
energy (as <a href="../../classes/baseCore/paladin.html">paladin</a>);
aura of courage (as <a href="../../classes/baseCore/paladin.html">paladin</a>).</p>
<h4><a id="cloistered-cleric" name="cloistered-cleric"></a>Cloistered Cleric</h4>
<p>The cloistered cleric spends more time than other clerics in
study and prayer and less in martial training. He gives up some
of the cleric's combat prowess in exchange for greater skill
access and a wider range of spells devoted to knowledge (and the
protection of knowledge).</p>
<p>Most cloistered clerics are nonchaotic, since they believe
that a disciplined lifestyle lends itself better to learning.</p>
<p><b>Hit Die</b>: The cloistered cleric uses a d6 for his Hit Die (and has hit
points at 1st level equal to 6 + Con modifier).</p>
<p><b>Base Attack Bonus</b>: The cloistered cleric's lack of martial training means that he
uses the poor base attack bonus.</p>
<h5>Class Skills</h5>
<p>The cloistered cleric's class skill list includes
<a href="../../skills/skillsAll.html#decipher-script">Decipher Script</a>,
<a href="../../skills/skillsAll.html#speak-language">Speak Language</a>, and all
<a href="../../skills/skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> skills (from the
<a href="../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/domains.html#knowledge">Knowledge domain</a>, see below).
The cloistered cleric gains skill points per level equal to 6 +
Int modifier (and has this number &times; 4 at 1st level).
<h5>Class Features</h5>
<p>The cloistered cleric has all the standard cleric class features,
except as noted below.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Cloistered clerics are proficient
with <a href="../../feats/featsAll.html#simple-weapon-proficiency">simple weapons</a>
and with <a href="../../feats/featsAll.html#armor-proficiency-light">light armor</a>.</p>
<p><b>Lore (Ex)</b>: Thanks to long hours of study, a cloistered cleric has a wide
range of stray knowledge. This ability is identical to the bard's
<a href="../../classes/baseCore/bard.html#bardic-knowledge">bardic
knowledge</a> class feature, using the cloistered cleric's class
level in place of the bard level.</p>
<p><b>Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells</b>: Most cloistered clerics worship deities associated with knowledge
and learning.</p>
<p>In addition to any domains selected from his deity's list, a
cloistered cleric automatically gains
the <a href="../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/domains.html#knowledge">Knowledge
domain</a> as a bonus domain (even if the Knowledge domain is not
normally available to clerics of that deity). He gains the
Knowledge domain granted power and may select his bonus domain
spell from the Knowledge domain or from one of his two regular
domains.</p>
<p><b>Spellcasting</b>: Add the following spells to the cloistered cleric's class spell
list:</p>
<p>0 - <a href="../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#message">message</a>;</p>

<a id="crusader" name="crusader"></a>
<h4>Crusader</h4>
<p>The crusader is a holy warrior, a martial priest dedicated to
battling the enemies of his church and spreading the teachings
of his deity throughout the lands. The crusader is in many
respects akin to the paladin, but is devoted solely to
ridding the world of the followers of enemy gods, rather than
the paladin's code. She wields weapon and spell with equal
faculty, and is willing either to lead others into battle or
to stand against the enemy alone.</p>
<p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>
<h5>Class Skills</h5>
<p>The crusader's class skills (and the key ability for each
skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Handle Animal
(Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int),
Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int),
Profession (Wis), Ride, (Dex), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
<p><b>Skill Points at 1st Level</b>: (2 + Int modifier) &times; 4.</p>

<h5>Class Features</h5>
<p>All of the following are class features of the crusader.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: The crusader is proficient with
all simple weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields
(including tower shields). In addition, the crusader may
choose a single martial weapon with which she is proficient,
as though she had the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat.</p>
<p><b>Deific Foe (Ex)</b>: At 1st level and every 5 levels thereafter, a
crusader must choose a deity opposed to her own god. The
crusader gains a +4 morale bonus to attack and damage rolls
against worshipers of the chosen deific foe.</p>
<p><b>Turn Foe's Followers (Su)</b>: Starting at ist level, the crusader
may turn or destroy worshipers of her deific foe. This is
resolved just like a normal cleric's turn undead ability,
except that the ability only affects worshipers of the deific
foe. A crusader can use this ability a number of times per day
equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. A crusader with 5 or more
ranks of Knowledge (religion) gains a +2 bonus on turning
checks against worshipers of her deific foe.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: The crusader gains a bonus feat at 3rd level and
every five levels thereafter. These feats must come from the
fighter's bonus feat list, with the following alteration:
Remove Weapon Specialization and Greater Weapon Specialization
from the list (as clerics cannot take those feats), and
replace it with Combat Casting.</p>
<p><b>Smite (Su)</b>: Once per day, beginning at 5th level, a crusader
may make a smite attack against any foe, so long as the foe
does not worship the crusader's deity and does not share
either the deity's or the crusader's alignment. She adds her
Charisma bonus to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of
damage per crusader level. If the crusader accidentally smites
a creature that does not qualify by the above conditions, the
smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for the
day. At 10th, 15th, and 20th level the crusader gains an
additional smite attempt per day.</p>
<a id="dead-levels" name="dead-levels"></a>
<h4>Dead Levels</h4>
<p>The cleric has nineteen dead levels, but this is mitigated by their
one and only special ability: turn or rebuke undead. The turning damage
for this ability steadily increases every level (2d6 + the cleric's
level + the cleric's Charisma modifier). Still, a prestige class that
grants +1 level of divine spellcasting, normal turn or rebuke undead
advancement, and special abilities at every level opens the door for
a minor dead level ability.</p>
<p><b>Undead Intuition (Ex)</b>: Starting at 2nd level, a cleric can identify
undead creatures during an encounter from any distance. The cleric
gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks to identify undead
creatures, but gains no insight about their special powers or
vulnerabilities. See the <a href="../../skills/skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> skill description.
Moreover, the cleric can make these Knowledge (undead)
checks untrained. This bonus increases by +1 for each cleric level
the character takes after 2nd level.</p>
<a id="destroy-undead" name="destroy-undead"></a>
<img src="../../resource/images/classes/vEtCRcleric.jpg" class="wrap" />
<h4>Destroy Undead</h4>
<p>You can channel positive energy to destroy undead creatures.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: Instead of the cleric's normal ability to turn or
rebuke undead, a lightbringer cleric can channel positive
energy to destroy undead. Thus, a lightbringer cleric contributes to the destruction of
undead in a fashion that interacts
well with the other
characters in the party such
as the fighter and wizard.
Lightbringer clerics want to
destroy undead; thus, they
despise seeing turned undead
run away never seen
again. At other times,
a standard turning
effect has no effect
whatsoever, much to
the chagrin of the lightbringer
cleric.</p>
<p>Destroying undead is a
standard action that deals
1d6 points of damage
per cleric level to
all undead within
30 feet of the
cleric. The affected
undead get a
Will save (DC 10 + cleric level + Cha modifier) for half damage.
Undead with turn resistance
can subtract
that number from
the damage that they
take from each turn
attempt. For example,
a vampire with turn
resistance +4 takes 4
fewer points of damage
each time he takes turning
damage.</p>
</p>When using this ability
against incorporeal creatures,
the lightbringer cleric does
not have to roll a 50% miss
chance; turning hits them
automatically.</p>
<p>Destroy undead still
counts as turn undead for
the purpose of meeting
prerequisites for feats, prestige
classes, and so forth. A
lightbringer cleric can use
this ability the same number
of times per day that he could
turn undead. If a feat requires
the expenditure of one or more
uses of turn undead, it instead
consumes uses of this ability.
Any ability that grants a bonus
to turning checks instead
grants an equal bonus to
this ability's save DC. This
is a supernatural ability.</p>
<a id="divine-counterspell" name="divine-counterspell"></a>
<h4>Divine Counterspell</h4>
<p>Although the ability to turn undead is arguably
a defining cleric characteristic, some clerics
(and paladins) find that they can
be even more effective crusaders
by opposing evil spellcasters. The
ability to negate an enemy spellcasters
magic grants a character an unexpected
edge.</p>
<p><b>Class</b>: Cleric or paladin.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st (cleric) or 4th (paladin).</p>
<p><b>Special Requirement</b>: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: You do not gain the ability to turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain the supernatural ability
to counter another spellcaster's magic
through pure force of will. This ability
functions just as if you were using dispel
magic to counter the spell, except that you
add your cleric level (instead of your caster
level) to the d20 roll. You don't need to
identify the spell the opposing spellcaster
is casting to make the attempt.</p>
<p>If you don't have a cleric level, use your
effective cleric level for the purpose of
turning undead. For example, a paladin
would normally turn undead
as a cleric of three levels lower;
her effective cleric level for
counterspelling is equal to her
paladin level - 3.</p>
<p>You can attempt to counterspell a number of times per day
equal to 1 + your Cha modifier.</p>
<p>A character with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana)
gets a +2 bonus on counterspelling attempts when using
this ability.</p>
<a id="divine-magician" name="divine-magician"></a>
<h4>Divine Magician</h4>
<p>Deities influence the world through the divine spells they
grant their worshipers. Some clerics, however, choose to
explore magical powers beyond those commonly provided
by the gods. By giving up some of their divine power, these
clerics gain access to spells normally beyond their abilities.</p>
<p>This class feature can be chosen only once.</p>
<p><b>Class</b>: Cleric.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Special Requirement</b>: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: You gain only one domain (including spells and
granted power) at 1st level, rather than two.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You can add one 1st-level abjuration, divination,
or necromancy wizard spell to your cleric spell list.
Each time you gain the ability to cast a new level of cleric
spells, you can add a single wizard spell of the same level from
one of those schools to your cleric spell list.</p>
<a id="divine-restoration" name="divine-restoration"></a>
<h4>Divine Restoration</h4>
<p>When you or your teammates lose your strength in the
middle of a dungeon, you can't always "call it a day" and rest.
You can restore the party's hit points by trading spells for
healing magic, but other setbacks besides physical injury
might impede your progress: insidious disease, vermin
poison, or noxious fumes. By focusing your divine purpose,
you can restore your party's lost abilities.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 3rd.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: If you select this alternative class feature, you
sacrifice one of your domain granted powers.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: At 3rd level, select one of your chosen cleric
domains. You can still select and cast spells from that
domain list, but you no longer can use the domain's granted
power. Instead, you gain the ability to spontaneously cast
lesser restoration, restoration, or greater restoration by sacrificing
a prepared spell of the same level.</p>
<p>For example, Jozan is 3rd level and selects this
alternate class feature. He had chosen the Healing and
Protection domains at 1st level. He gives up the Healing
domain granted power. He no longer casts healing
spells at +1 caster level, but he can sacrifice a prepared
2nd-level spell to spontaneously cast lesser restoration.
At 7th level, he'll be able to sacrifice a 4th-level spell
to cast restoration, and at 13th level, a 7th-level spell to
cast greater restoration.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: When spontaneously casting a restoration spell,
you must still expend the required components.</p>
<a id="domain-focus" name="domain-focus"></a>
<h4>Domain Focus</h4>
<p>Clerics lose their way the most easily, especially at lower
levels. Even more experienced clerics sometimes become shaken
by unexpected tragedies. When a cleric loses his way and sees
only the "pure" version of his deity, he focuses on a single
aspect of his deity to the exclusion of all others.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: If you select this class feature, you lose the
ability to spontaneously convert prepared spells into cure or
inflict spells. You also lose access to one of your domains
and all spells on that domain spell list are permanently
removed from all your spell lists.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain many of the benefits of your remaining
domain as if you had taken it twice.</p>
<p>You gain double the benefit from your remaining domain's
granted power, if applicable. If your remaining domain granted
power has a limited number of uses per day, you may use the
domain granted power twice as many times per day; if your
remaining domain granted power offers a bonus, the bonus is
doubled. If your remaining domain granted power has limited
uses and also grants a bonus (such as the granted power of the
Destruction domain), you must choose which to double: the
number of times per day you can use it or double the bonus;
you do not gain both. The number of uses per day that doubles
dots not count additional uses based on ability scores. For
example, domain granted powers that grant you the ability to
turn or rebuke elemental creatures grant you that ability a
number of times per day equal to 6 + your Charisma modifier,
and not 6 + double your Charisma modifier.</p>
<a id="dragonblood-cleric" name="dragonblood-cleric"></a>
<h4>Dragonblood Cleric</h4>
<p>Dragonblood creatures are naturally inclined toward arcane
magic. Some hear the call of a deity, however, and become
clerics instead. Dragonblood clerics focus on the elemental
affinities of their draconic bloodline.</p>
<p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>
<h5>Requirements</h5>
<p>To take a dragonblood cleric substitution level, a character
must have the dragonblood subtype and be about to take

<h5>Class Features</h5>
<p>All the following are class features of the dragonblood
cleric racial substitution levels.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: The following substitution level class features
require the dragonblood cleric to select one energy type
from among acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic. The energy
type must be the same for all these substitution features.</p>
<p>A half-dragon who takes one or more of these substitution
levels must choose the energy type that matches her
breath weapon (if possible). If a half-dragon cleric's breath
weapon doesn't have an energy type, she can choose any
energy type so long as it is the same for all substitution
level class features.</p>
<p>A dragonblood cleric who doesn't take the 1st-level racial
substitution level can expend turn undead uses in place
of turn energy uses if she takes the 5th- or 9th-level racial
substitution levels.</p>
<p><b>Turn Energy (Su)</b>: Starting at 1st level, a dragonblood
cleric can channel the elemental power of dragons to grant
her and her allies protection from energy a number of times
per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke
attacks of opportunity. The cleric and all allies within
30 feet gain temporary immunity to the specified energy
type. Each protected ally remains immune until the effect
protects him from 5 points of energy damage per cleric
level, after which the effect is discharged for that ally. If
it is not discharged, the benefit of the effect fades after 1
minute per cleric level. The cleric can exclude herself and
any allies she chooses from the effect.</p>
<p>Turn energy overlaps and does not stack with the effect
of the resist energy spell. If a character is warded by both
this effect and resist energy, this effect absorbs damage until
it is discharged. Turn energy stacks with the effect of the
protection from energy spell.</p>
<p>This substitution level class feature replaces the standard
cleric's turn or rebuke undead class feature. For a
dragonblood cleric, turn energy counts as turn or rebuke
undead for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for feats,
prestige classes, and so on.</p>
<p><b>Energy Barrier (Su)</b>: A dragonblood cleric who takes
the 5th-level racial substitution level can expend one of her
turn energy (or turn undead) uses for the day to create a
wall of energy. This ability functions like the benefit of the
<a href="../../feats/noncore-featsrotd.html#EXHALED BARRIER">Exhaled Barrier</a> feat, except as noted below.</p>
<p>Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of
energy damage per two cleric levels the dragonblood cleric
possesses. If the cleric creates the wall so that it appears where
creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through
the wall. Either way, a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the
cleric's class level + her Con modifier) halves this damage.</p>
<p>This substitution feature replaces the 3rd-level spell slot
gained by a standard cleric at 5th level. From 5th level on,
a dragonblood cleric who takes this substitution level can
prepare one less 3rd-level spell per day than shown on Table:
<a href="#table-the-cleric">The Cleric</a>.</p>
<p><b>Energy Sustenance (Su)</b>: A dragonblood cleric who
takes the 9th-level racial substitution level can expend
one of her turn energy (or turn undead) uses for the day
to gain the benefit of energy sustenance. The energy type
selected for this ability can now heal the cleric.</p>
<p>To use energy sustenance, the cleric expends a turn
energy use as an immediate action when she is subjected
to an attack that deals energy damage of the specified
type. If she does so, she heals 1 point of damage for every
3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the
amount of healing would cause the cleric to exceed her
full normal hit points, she gains any excess as temporary
hit points that last for up to 1 hour. When a dragonblood
cleric uses this ability, she willingly fails any saving throw
against the incoming energy effect.</p>
<p>This substitution feature replaces the 5th-level spell slot
gained by a standard cleric at 9th level. From 9th level on,
a dragonblood cleric who takes this substitution level can
prepare one less 5th-level spell per day than shown on Table:
<a href="#table-the-cleric">The Cleric</a>.</p>
<a id="dragonscale-husk" name="dragonscale-husk"></a>
<h4>Dragonscale Husk</h4>
<p>Any warrior knows that skill in
battle isn't enough; you must
also guard against the attacks of
your enemies. A well-forged suit
of armor can mean the difference
between life and death, but
a warrior whose very body is his
armor has an immediate advantage.
Those who have the blood
of dragons running in their veins
can gain this benefit.</p>
<p><b>Class</b>: Any standard class that
grants proficiency in heavy armor,
such as fighter or paladin.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st (unless the class grants proficiency in heavy
armor at a level other than 1st, in which case this feature can
be taken only at that level).</p>
<p><b>Special Requirement</b>: You must be of the dragonblood
subtype to select this alternative class feature.
As long as you gain the dragonblood subtype at the same
level that you would gain heavy armor proficiency, you can
select this class feature, even if you would normally choose
class features before selecting the option that grants you the
subtype. For example, a 1st-level human fighter who takes
<a href="../../feats/noncore-featsdragonmagic.html#DRAGONTOUCHED">Dragontouched</a>
as one of his 1st-level feats could also select this class feature.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: If you select this class feature, you do not gain
proficiency with any kind of armor. If you would later gain
some form of armor proficiency (such as by multiclassing or
taking a feat), you can choose at that time to gain that profi
ciency, but you then lose this class feature. If you already
have proficiency with any kind of armor, you must lose that
proficiency in order to select this class feature.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain the extraordinary ability to grow a thick,
scaly hide that protects you like armor. The dragonscale husk
resembles the scales of a dragon of your choice (selected
when you gain the class feature). The husk requires 8 hours
to grow, but this process can take place at night while you
are sleeping.</p>
<p>Your scaled hide grants you a bonus to your Armor Class
equal to 6 + 1/3 your class level in the
class that granted you heavy armor
proficiency (+7 bonus to
AC at 3rd level, +8 bonus to
AC at 6th level, and so on, up
to a maximum +12 bonus to
AC at 18th level). Multiple
classes that grant this proficiency stack for determining the
dragonscale husk's total bonus.
This bonus doesn't stack with
any feat, racial trait, or other
special ability that would grant
you a bonus to Armor Class.</p>
<p>In addition, as you attain
higher levels, your husk grants
you increasing resistance to
acid, cold, electricity, and fire.
You gain resistance 5 at 5th level,
resistance 10 at 10th level,
resistance 15 at 15th level, and
resistance 20 at 20th level.</p>
<p>Your dragonscale husk is
treated as medium armor for
the purpose of determining
your speed and whether you
can use class features or other
special abilities. It allows a
maximum Dexterity bonus
to Armor Class of +2 and has
an armor check penalty of
-4. You can sleep in your husk
without penalty. You cannot wear any other armor while
your husk is present.</p>
<p>Your husk isn't treated as armor for the purpose of being
affected by spells or other abilities. You can't grant it an
enhancement bonus with magic vestment, nor can you imbue
it with special properties, as you could a normal suit of
armor.</p>
<p>You can't take off your dragonscale husk, but you can
choose to shed it. Doing this requires 10 minutes of concentration
and results in your sloughing off a pile of scales that
crumble to dust if handled.</p>
<a id="drow-cleric" name="drow-cleric"></a>
<h4>Drow Cleric</h4>
<p>Everything you do, everything you are, is devoted heart and
soul to Lolth: to spreading her power across the Underdark,
and, of course, to cementing your own base of power among
the drow. How better to honor the Weaver of Webs, after all,
than to ensure that so potent and loyal a servant as yourself
can direct her minions?</p>
<h5>Master of Spiders</h5>
<p>Spiders - the favored of Lolth and the totems of your
race - respond to your call, bowing before you as they do before the
divine mistress you both serve.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: If you select this class feature, you do not gain
the standard cleric's ability to turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You can rebuke or command vermin as an evil
cleric rebukes or commands undead. When commanding
spiders, you gain a +4 bonus to your effective turning level.</p>
<p>This ability otherwise works exactly as rebuke undead. You
can use this ability in place of turn or rebuke undead for the
purpose of qualifying for divine feats.</p>
<a id="dwarf-cleric" name="dwarf-cleric"></a>
<h4>Dwarf Cleric</h4>
<p>The dwarf cleric dedicates herself to her clan and the forge.
She takes an active role in defending her people, often serving
on the front lines of a battle. In exchange for greater
martial ability and power when casting spells of the earth,
the cleric gives up her ability to turn or rebuke undead and
some of her spellcasting prowess.</p>
<p><b>Hit Die</b>: d10.</p>
<h5>Requirements</h5>
<p>To take a dwarf cleric substitution level, a character must be
a dwarf about to take her 1st, 4th, or 8th level of cleric.</p>
<h5>Class Skills</h5>
<p>Dwarf cleric substitution levels have the class skills of
the standard cleric class plus Knowledge (dungeoneering)
(Int).</p>
<p><b>Skill Points at Each Level</b>: 2 + Int modifier (or four
times this number as a beginning character).</p>

<h5>Class Features</h5>
<p>All the following are features of the dwarf cleric's racial
substitution levels.</p>
<p><b>Smite Giants (Su)</b>: A dwarf cleric who takes the 1st-level
racial substitution level can attempt to smite a giant with
a melee attack, similar to the way a paladin smites an evil
creature. She adds her Constitution bonus (if any) to her
attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per cleric
level. The cleric can use this ability a number of times per
day equal to 1 + her Con modifier (minimum once per day).
If the cleric accidentally smites a creature that is not a giant,
the smite has no effect but still counts as one of the cleric's
daily smite attempts.</p>
<p>This substitution benefit replaces the standard cleric's
ability to turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Hammer Specialist (Ex)</b>: A dwarf cleric's dedication
to the forge-god results in exceptional skill with the warhammer.
A dwarf cleric who takes the 4th-level racial
substitution level gains the Martial Weapon Proficiency
(warhammer) feat (if she doesn't already have it). She also
gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when wielding a warhammer
in melee.</p>
<p>This racial substitution level is only available to dwarf
clerics who follow Moradin (or any other deity whose
favored weapon is a warhammer).</p>
<p>This benefit replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a
standard cleric at 4th level. From now on, the cleric can
prepare one fewer 2nd-level cleric spell than indicated on
Table: <a href="#table-the-cleric">The Cleric</a>.</p>
<p><b>Earthen Spell Power (Ex)</b>: A dwarf cleric who takes
the 8th-level racial substitution level draws power from the
earth when casting certain spells. When she is in contact
with the ground, the cleric's effective caster level when
casting spells with the earth descriptor (or any spell from
the Earth domain, such as stoneskin) increases by one. This
increase applies when determining level-dependent spell
variables and on caster level checks. This increase stacks
with other spell power abilities, such as from the hierophant
prestige class.</p>
<p>This benefit replaces the 4th-level spell slot gained by a
standard cleric at 8th level. From now on, the cleric can prepare
one fewer 4th-level cleric spell than indicated on Table:
<a href="#table-the-cleric">The Cleric</a>.</p>
<a id="evangelist" name="evangelist"></a>
<h4>Evangelist</h4>
<p>Variably respected, scorned, or feared by other clerics, the
evangelist has an intensely personal relationship with his
deity. He has little if any formal training, and did not
necessarily set out to serve a god; instead, his link with his
deity developed naturally, not unlike a sorcerer's
spellcasting ability. Evangelists have a narrower range of
spells than a cleric, but they are capable of casting their
spells spontaneously, with no need for advance preparation.</p>
<p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>
<h5>Class Skills</h5>
<p>The evangelist's class skills (and the key ability for each
skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha),
Gather Information (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (local) (lnt),
Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft
(Int).</p>
<p><b>Skill Points at 1st Level</b>: (2 + Int modifier) &times; 4.</p>
<p><b>Skill Points at Each Additional Level</b>: 2 + int modifier.</p>

<h5>Class Features</h5>
<p>All of the following are class features of the evangelist.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: The evangelist is proficient
with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with
shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><b>Evangelist Spellcasting</b>: The evangelist casts divine spells
from the cleric spell list. His spellcasting ability is based
on his Wisdom score. The evangelist casts these divine spells
and gains spells known from the cleric list as a sorcerer
casts arcane spells and gains spells from the sorcerer/wizard
list. See the "Spells" ability of the sorcerer class for
details. Note that the evangelist cannot learn a new divine
spell in place of domain spells known.</p>
<p><b>Domains</b>: At 1st level, the evangelist chooses two domains. He
gains the granted ability of both domains, and he adds all the
spells listed on the domain spell list to his spells known
list at the appropriate levels (although he still can't cast
these spells unless he is of appropriate level). The
evangelist does not gain the cleric's ability to cast extra
spells chosen from the domain lists.</p>
<a id="golarion-cleric" name="golarion-cleric"></a>
<h4>Golarion Cleric</h4>
<p>Some clerics think of themselves more
as holy warriors than proselytizers or shepherds. For these
clerics, the ability to fight trumps all
other concerns. Taking the above ability
requires a cleric to give up both of
her domains, including her
domain powers.</p>
<p><b>Holy Warrior (Ex)</b>: A cleric with this ability is proficient with
her deity's favored weapon. In addition, her base attack
bonus as a cleric equals her cleric level, and her cleric Hit Die
becomes a d10.</p>
<a id="improved-domain-powers" name="improved-domain-powers"></a>
<h4>Improved Domain Powers</h4>
<p>Clerics differ immensely in mission, role, and outlook
depending on the deities they worship. No one would ever
mistake a blood-soaked zealot of Erythnul the Many for a staid
healer of Pelor the Burning Hate, for example. Cleric domains
reinforce this notion, granting a wide range of specialized
abilities and unique spells depending on a cleric's specific
field of expertise.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even these specialized powers are not enough to
truly define the differences in faith. A vicious cleric of
Hextor and a valiant cleric of Heironeous might both share the
exact same domains of Law and War, for example. The following
rules present new powers attached to the core domains
presented in the Player's Handbook. Many of these alternative
powers go above and beyond the standard domain abilities and,
as such, require the cleric to forego other abilities or take
a feat.</p>
<h5>Attaining Improved Powers</h5>
<p>The simplest way a cleric can gain access to the additional
powers of his domains is through the selection of the Improved
Power feat. While other options exist, the DM must decide
which possibilities he allows in his campaign and may add
additional requirements as well, such as a sacred quest or
special ritual. Some DMs might even choose to make these
improved powers a boon granted to clerics who reach a certain
level. While the feat and magic item options allow these new
powers to be incorporated into an existing campaign, the other
options are best if presented to characters at the start of a
campaign.</p>
<p><i>Feat</i>: The ability to use one of the improved powers represents
deep devotion and time spent learning about one aspect of a
deity. In this case, gaining access to an improved power is
best represented by the Improved Power feat. Clerics who take
this feat retain both of their granted domain abilities and
choose domain spells normally.</p>
<p><b>IMPROVED POWER [GENERAL]</b><br/>
Chose one of your domains. Through your long devotion and
hours of study, you have unlocked one of the improved granted
powers of that domain.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Granted power of the same domain as the
selected improved granted power.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You may use the improved granted power of the chosen
domain.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do
not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new
domain.</p>
<br/>
<p><i>Magic Item</i>: Temples have long known the secret of forging
special holy symbols that enhance the tie between a cleric and
his deity. These rare and valuable magic items bestow the
improved granted power while worn (see Devoted Symbol
below). Clerics who wear one of these symbols retain both of
their granted domain abilities and chose domain spells
normally.</p>
<p><b>DEVOTED SYMBOL</b><br/>
These rare holy symbols enhance the bond between a cleric and
his deity, granting access to one improved granted power.
Devoted symbols are tied to one specific domain and only grant
the power if the wearer already has that domain and is a
follower of the same deity. A devoted symbol of Vecna tied to
the Knowledge domain only grants the divine inspiration
ability if the wearer is a cleric of Vecna with the Knowledge
domain. Devoted symbols are worn around the neck, taking up
the amulet slot, and can be used as a holy symbol for the
purposes of turning or rebuking undead and as a spell focus.</p>
<p>Moderate divination; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, divination;
Price 20,000 gp; Weight 1/2 lb.</p>
<br/>
<p><i>No Turning</i>: Some clerics never give a second thought to
undead, as such monsters are outside the ethos of their
figths. These clerics might wish for alternative uses for
channeled divine energy. Instead of turning or rebuking
undead, these clerics gain one of the improved powers
associated with their chosen domains. They still gain both of
the standard granted powers and may choose domain spells from
either list as normal. The choice to use this option must be
made when the first level of cleric is taken. The ability to
turn or rebuke undead from other classes is not affected by
this choice.</p>
<p>Paladins may elect to use this option as well, but must wait
until 4th level to gain an improved power. As with turning
undead, a paladin's effective level for these powers is that
of a cleric three levels lower. A paladin must chose one of
the domains associated with her deity, and if she has cleric
levels the improved power must be from one of her chosen
domains. A paladin with cleric levels cannot gain both
improved powers through sacrificing the ability to turn
undead from both classes. The choice to use this option must
be made when the fourth level of paladin is taken.</p>
<p><i>One Power</i>: Some clerics focus so heavily on one aspect of
their deity that they develop powers beyond those of their
brethren. Instead of gaining two granted domain powers, these
clerics choose one domain and gain the improved granted power
instead of either of the standard granted powers. When
choosing domain spells, these clerics may choose from both
domains as normal. The choice to use this option must be made
when the first level of cleric is taken.</p>
<h5>Improved powers</h5>
<p>The following powers represent all of the domains present in
the Player's Handbook. Other powers are certainly possible for
domains from other sources. Unless otherwise noted, activating
an improved granted power is a standard action that does not
provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<h5>AIR</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Far-Reaching Wind (Su)</b>: The touch of your holy symbol imbues a
weapon with the essence of air. Air-imbued weapons are guided
to their targets by gusts of wind, allowing supernatural
accuracy over long distances. While under this effect, ranged
weapons have their range increments doubled, and melee weapons
may be hurled as thrown weapons with a range increment of 20
feet. Weapons enhanced in this way maintain their increased
range for 1 minute. You may use this ability a number of times
per day equal to your cleric level.</p>
<h5>ANIMAL</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Totemic Spirit Companion (Sp)</b>: You can call upon the spirits
of the natural world to aid you as a full-round action. This
functions just like the spell summon nature's ally I using
your cleric level as the caster level. All creatures summoned
in this way have either the celestial or fiendish template as
appropriate to the type of energy you channel. You may use
this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you
possess (minimum 1). Additional uses of this ability may be
expended to summon more powerful creatures, with each
additional use spent increasing the spell to the next highest
level. For example, a 6th-level cleric could use this ability
to cast summon nature's ally I three times per day or summon
nature's ally III once per day (or any other combination).</p>
<h5>CHAOS</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Chaos Curse (Su)</b>: A forking beam of multicolored light springs
from your outstretched finger and strikes an enemy within 60
feet as a ranged touch attack. If your target fails a Will
save (DC 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier),
it becomes stricken with random misfortune for 1 minute. Each
round, the target has a 50% chance to drop what it is holding
(if holding anything) or to provoke an attack of opportunity
(if threatened and not holding anything). If neither condition
applies, it falls prone. You may use this ability once per day
for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).</p>
<h5>DEATH</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Call of the Grave (Su)</b>: Creatures near you feel the
inevitability of death and resist attempts to keep them among
the living. When activated, all conjuration spells of the
healing subschool cast within 30 feet of you heal half as much
damage as normal. In addition, spells that restore life, such
as raise dead, reincarnate, and resurrection do not function
when cast within 30 feet of you. You may use this ability 1
round per day per cleric level you possess. These rounds need
not be consecutive.</p>
<h5>DESTRUCTION</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Shattering Blow (Su)</b>: You may, as a free action, infuse your
attacks with the destructive force of entropy for 1 round.
While under this effect, your natural attacks and all weapons
you use in melee are treated as adamantine for the purposes of
bypassing damage reduction and object hardness. You may use
this ability 1 round per day per cleric level you possess and
these rounds need not be consecutive.</p>
<h5>EARTH</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Tremor Step (Su)</b>: While standing on a solid, natural surface
(caves or fields would both work; the upper floors of a tower
would not) you may strike the earth to produce highly
localized seismic vibrations. All creatures except you
standing on the ground within 20 feet of you must make Balance
checks (DC 10 + your cleric level + your Charisma modifier) or
fall prone. You may use this ability once per day for every
two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).</p>
<h5>EVIL</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Torture Strike (Su)</b>: One living creature touched (requiring a
successful melee touch attack) is wracked by agonizing pain,
as if a branding iron had struck bare flesh. You gain a bonus
on Intimidate checks against an affected creature equal to
your cleric level for 1 minute. In addition, the target
creature also takes 1d4 points of Strength damage and is
nauseated for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 +
1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier) reduces the
condition to sickened and negates the Strength damage. You may
use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you
possess (minimum 1).</p>
<h5>FIRE</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Flame-Guiding Song (Su)</b>: Your voice has a hypnotic power over
fire. You can cause flames to lash out at those nearby,
attacking one foe within 10 feet of an existing blaze. These
hungry flames deal 2d6 points of fire damage and might cause
the target to catch fire. The Reflex save DC to avoid catching
on fire or to extinguish these flames equals 10 + 1/2 your
cleric level + your Charisma modifier. You may also use this
ability to automatically extinguish nonmagical fires no larger
than a bonfire. You may use this ability once per day for
every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).</p>
<h5>GOOD</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Saving Grace (Su)</b>: You can grant a divine boon to your allies,
assisting them in their endeavors. You can bestow this boon
upon an ally within 30 feet as a move action. This boon grants
a sacred bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on the next
saving throw, attack roll, skill check, or ability check he
attempts within the next minute. You may use this ability once
per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).</p>
<h5>HEALING</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Healing Light (Su)</b>: You may channel divine energy as a free
action to enhance a spell of the healing subschool. When using
this ability, such spells with a range of touch may be cast
with a range of close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). You may use
this ability a number of times per day equal to your cleric
level.</p>
<h5>KNOWLEDGE</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Divine Inspiration (Su)</b>: You can glimpse into the mind of your
deity, granting you unsurpassed powers of recall and
intuition. You can channel divine energy to take to on any
Knowledge skill check as if you had ranks in it, even if you
are untrained, as a free action. You may add your Charisma
bonus to the check in addition to your Intelligence bonus. You
may use this ability a number of times per day equal to you
cleric level.</p>
<h5>LAW</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Zone of Enforced Order (Su)</b>: You can emit an aura that makes
chaotic creatures uncomfortable. When in effect, all chaotic
creatures within 30 feet of you take a -2 penalty on attack
rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. You
may use this ability 1 round per day per cleric level you
possess. These rounds need not be consecutive.</p>
<h5>LUCK</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Charmed Existence (Su)</b>: You may, as an immediate action, use
this ability to gain a +2 luck bonus on an attack roll, saving
throw, skill check, or ability check. You must decide to use
this ability before you roll and may only use this ability
once per round. You may use this ability once per day for
every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).</p>
<h5>MAGIC</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Power Magical Device (Su)</b>: You can channel divine energy
through a wand, staff, or other charged magical item, powering
it with faith rather than the item's own internal reserves.
Doing so requires only as much time as is required to activate
the item normally (typically a standard action). The magic
item produces all its normal effects, but no charge is
drained. To power an item, your caster level must be at least
equal to the caster level of the item. You cannot use this
ability to duplicate spells with an XP or costly material
component. Abilities that require multiple charges require you
to spend an equal number of uses of this ability. You may use
this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you
possess (minimum 1).</p>
<h5>PROTECTION</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Shield of the Martyr (Su)</b>: You can prevent harm to others at
the cost of your own safety. Whenever an ally within 30 feet
takes damage, you can channel divine energy as an immediate
action to split the wounds between the target and yourself
(each taking half damage; if an odd number you take the extra
point of damage). This ability can only be used once per
round and only against a single damage source. You may use
this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you
possess (minimum 1).</p>
<h5>STRENGTH</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Tremendous Might (Su)</b>: You can channel divine power into feats
of truly superhuman might. You may add a +6 morale bonus on
any Strength-based skill check or Strength check required to
break, lift, drag, or push on object. This does not apply to
attack or damage rolls, including grapple, sunder, or bull
rush attempts. You may use this ability a number of times per
day equal to your cleric level.</p>
<h5>SUN</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Vengeance of Day (Su)</b>: Rays of light brighter than the noon
sun burst from your raised holy symbol. All within a 30 foot
cone must make Will saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your cleric level +
your Charisma modifier) or be dazzled for a number of rounds
equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). Undead and
creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity, such as
kobolds or drow, are blinded instead on a failed save. You may
use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you
possess (minimum 1).</p>
<h5>TRAVEL</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Second Wind (Su)</b>: You touch your holy symbol to a creature,
imbuing it with renewed vigor for travel and great speed. You
can remove the fatigued condition or make an exhausted
creature merely fatigued. If the target creature has neither
of these conditions, this ability instead increases the
creature's base speed by +30 feet for 1 round. You may use
this ability a number of times per day equal to your cleric
level.</p>
<h5>TRICKERY</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Miraculous Deception (Su)</b>: You can channel divine power to
improve the skills you naturally develop in service of your
trickster deity. Using this ability grants you a +4 divine
bonus on a single Bluff, Disguise, or Hide skill check. You
may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your
cleric level.</p>
<h5>WAR</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Piercing Steel Talon (Su)</b>: When wielding your deity's chosen
weapon, you can channel divine energy into a single deadly
blow. You instinctively attack the weakest points of your
target's defenses, allowing you to, as a free action, ignore
either the target's armor or shield bonus to AC for a single
attack. You may use this ability once per day for every two
cleric levels you possess (minimum 1), but no more than once
per round.</p>
<h5>WATER</h5>
<p class="initial"><b>Waves Protect Their Own (Su)</b>: When at least waist deep in
water, you can summon a vortex of swift currents and crashing
waves to aid your allies and buffet your enemies. Allies
within 30 feet suffer no penalties for underwater combat (as
if under a freedom of movement effect) and suffer no risk of
drowning in even the roughest seas (although if they choose to
dive below the waves they can hold their breath no longer than
normal). Enemies in the area take a penalty on attack rolls
equal to your Charisma modifier due to the impeding flow of
the water (having a swim speed does not negate this penalty,
although a freedom of movement effect does). You may use this
ability 1 round per day per cleric level you possess. These
rounds need not be consecutive.</p>
<a id="no-turning" name="no-turning"></a>
<h4>No Turning</h4>
<p>As any acolyte knows, the first divine skill taught to
neophytes is the channeling of raw positive or negative energy
through a properly prepared holy symbol. Most students
talented enough to cast spells have trained in this ability to
the point where it can drive away and even destroy undead - or
when reversed, control them. Yet, not all such individuals
learn to turn the undead. Some focus this divine energy to
excel in their own area of expertise while others eschew the
ability entirely in favor of more mundane skills. Such
individuals embrace this difference, identifying themselves
not simply as clerics, but with titles that reflect their
specialties, such as warrior priests, theologians, or cultists.</p>
<h5>CULTIST</h5>
<p>You are secretly a worshiper of a dark god, plotting foul
intrigues with others of your secretive cult.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks. As long as you
carry your holy symbol, you are immune to magical attempts to
uncover falsehoods, such as discern lies, zone of truth, and
similar effects.</p>
<h5>EVANGELIST</h5>
<p>You travel far and wide, making showy public sermons and
seeking converts to your religion.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a +2 bonus on diplomacy checks. An innate
talent for magic grants you the following spell-like ability
as a 1st-level caster: 2/day - comprehend languages. At 7th
level, you gain the following spell-like ability as a
7th-level caster: 1/day - tongues.</p>
<h5>FANATIC</h5>
<p>You are willing to die in the name of your deity, but you're
even quicker to kill in his name.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks. An innate
talent for magic grants you the following spell-like ability

<h5>HEALER</h5>
<p>You care most about curing the sick and injured, no matter
whom they serve or what the circumstance.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a +2 bonus on Heal checks. Whenever you cast
a conjuration (healing) spell on a creature other than
yourself, you gain a +2 sacred bonus to Armor Class and a +2
sacred bonus on Concentration checks to cast defensively until
the end of your next turn.</p>
<h5>JUSTICAR</h5>
<p>The cleric of a deity of honor, justice, or truth, you seek to
take prisoners alive for interrogation and fair punishment.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a +2 bonus on Sense Motive checks. Whenever
you deal enough damage to reduce a creature to negative hit
points, the creature automatically and immediately stabilizes.</p>
<h5>MYSTIC</h5>
<p>Deities operate beyond the understanding of most men. So do
you.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain an extra spell one level lower than the
highest level spell you can currently cast. This extra spell
is always one level lower than the highest-level spell you can
cast, so when you gain the ability to cast a higher-level
spell the level of the spell slot gained through this ability
also increases.</p>
<h5>RELIC HUNTER</h5>
<p>Your church tasks you to hunt down and reclaim holy - or
perhaps unholy - relics.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps
equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum +1). Additionally,
Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Search are always considered
class skills for you.</p>
<h5>SAGE</h5>
<p>The keeper of ancient truths and lores, you frequently study
the antiquarian writings of your faith.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks.
In addition, once per day, you may reroll a Knowledge check.
You must take the second roll, even if it isn't as good as the
original.</p>

the experience point cost to scribe a scroll is reduced by
25%, to a minimum of 1 XP.</p>
<h5>SHAMAN</h5>
<p>You are the wise elder and healer of a of a
wilderness-dwelling tribe.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn or rebuke undead and literacy (you are
illiterate).</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain an animal companion as a druid of half your
cleric level. Half your cleric levels stack with levels of any
other classes entitled to an animal companion (such as the
druid and ranger) for the purpose of determining your
companion's abilities and the alternative lists available to
you.</p>
<h5>THEOLOGIAN</h5>
<p>You are a wise and respected philosopher, frequently
meditating to comprehend the nature of the divine.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks.
As long as you conspicuously wear or carry your deity's holy
symbol you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws made to resist
divine spells, as well as the spells and spell-like abilities
of outsiders.</p>
<h5>WANDERER</h5>
<p>Never staying in one plate for long, you travel the world on
an endless religious quest, following the subtle signs and
portents your deity leaves you.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (local), Speak
Language, and Survival are class skills for you. You gain
Endurance as a bonus feat at 1st level.</p>
<h5>WARRIOR PRIEST</h5>
<p>As much a soldier as a member of the clergy, you fight to
protect your church, your fellow worshipers, and your ideals.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: Once per day, you may cast a quickened version of a
spell you have prepared (that wasn't prepared as a quickened
spell) targeting your weapon, shield, or armor. The spell's
level does not increase because of this ability.</p>
<h5>WEAPONMASTER</h5>
<p>You have devoted yourself to the mastery of your deity's
favored weapon.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: Turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a +2 bonus on Craft (weaponsmith). As long
as you wield your deity's favored weapon you no longer need a
free hand in order to cast spells. Essentially, you substitute
movements of your weapon for the somatic components of spells.</p>
<a id="peripheral-beliefs" name="peripheral-beliefs"></a>
<h4>Peripheral Beliefs</h4>
<p>Religions are steeped in dogma and traditions. The dogma of a
religion almost always comes directly from the deities whom
the religion reveres. Traditions, on the other hand, sometimes
form for reasons that have little to do with the faith's
deity. This article presents five sample peripheral beliefs,
from which you may choose up to two. If a cleric violates a
belief for any reason he loses its benefit until he receives
an atonement spell.</p>
<h5>DAILY PRAYER</h5>
<p>At specific times of day, you must perform a prayer while
facing a specific direction.</p>
<p><b>Restrictions</b>: You must stop to pray at the appropriate times,
regardless of your current situation. Most deities require at
least three 5-minute prayers each day (dawn, noon, and sunset)
but stricter lawful deities may also require prayers at
mid-morning and mid-afternoon.</p>
<p><b>Benefits</b>: Since you must always face the proper direction
while praying, you can automatically discern true north as if
you had 5 ranks in Survival. If you already have 5 ranks in
Survival you gain a +2 bonus on all Survival checks instead.</p>
<h5>DAY OF REST</h5>
<p>Every seventh day, you must refrain from all physical
activity, regardless of whether you are in town, on the road,
or in the dungeon.</p>
<p><b>Restrictions</b>: On the designated day, you cannot take attack
actions, cast spells with somatic components, activate
mechanical devices, or carry a load heavier than light.</p>
<p><b>Benefits</b>: Due to being especially well-rested, you gain a +4
bonus on all saves made against sleep effects and you do not
suffer a -10 penalty when making Listen checks while asleep.</p>
<h5>DIETARY RESTRICTION</h5>
<p>You believe a certain kind of food - such as all meat from a
certain kind of animal or from any animal not slain in a
specific way - is unclean. Any utensils or dishes used with
unclean food themselves become unclean and taint any other
food they touch.</p>
<p><b>Restrictions</b>: Any food prepared by someone other than a devout
follower of the religion, or any potion that is not created by
the cleric, violate these standards of cleanliness. (A detect
poison spell can detect these foods, since the cleric
perceives such fare as spiritual poison.)</p>
<p><b>Benefits</b>: Due to the careful choice of foods, the cleric is
especially healthy and gains a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves
against poisons and diseases.</p>
<h5>SACRED ANIMAL</h5>
<p>You consider some particular kind of animal sacred, such as
cats, cows, or birds. You cannot harm or impede a sacred
animal in any way and you must attempt to prevent others from
harming or impeding one.</p>
<p><b>Restrictions</b>: You cannot attack the sacred creature, even in
self-defense. If your allies choose to attack such a creature
in self-defense, you must ensure the creature survives, such
as binding its wounds once it goes unconscious. If your allies
are the aggressors, you cannot cast beneficial spells on them
for 24 hours after the combat ends.</p>
<p><b>Benefits</b>: Animals of the sacred kind feel a special affinity
for you and instinctively avoid attacking you unless in
self-defense or under magical compulsion (this benefit does
not extend to your allies). In addition, you gain a +4 bonus
on all Charisma-based skill checks when interacting with such
creatures.</p>
<h5>SACRED CLOTHING</h5>
<p>You must wear some particular item of clothing that takes up a
magic item slot, such as a head covering or a ceremonial
glove, at all times.</p>
<p><b>Restrictions</b>: Since the special clothing must be both worn and
displayed as a show of devotion, you cannot cover up or remove
it. This often means you must forego use of magic items that
would be worn in that slot. It might also cause you to commit
violations of etiquette in social situations.</p>
<p><b>Benefits</b>: The special item of clothing is of masterwork
quality and costs at least 25 gp. Wearing it grants you a +2
bonus on Charisma-based skill checks when dealing with other
followers of your religion and it may be enhanced using normal
magic item creation rules. A set of armor or other item that
grants you benefits cannot count as your sacred clothing.</p>
<h4><a id="planar-banishment" name="planar-banishment"></a>Planar Banishment</h4>
<p>Instead of channeling energy to <a href="../../basic/specialAttacks.html#turn">turn</a> or rebuke undead, with this
variant a cleric can channel energy to banish <a href="../../monsters/monsterTypes.html#outsider">outsiders</a>.</p>
<p>Make a turning check as normal. The result indicates the most
powerful outsider affected (treat an outsider as having Hit Dice
equal to its Hit Dice + its Cha modifier, if any). if the roll is
high enough to let the cleric affect at least some outsiders
within 60 feet, roll 2d6 + cleric's class level + cleric's Cha
modifier for turning damage. That's how many total Hit Dice of
outsiders the cleric affects.</p>
<p>Any outsider affected by the turning attempt is banished back
to its home plane. (If it is already on its home plane, there is
no effect.) Even if it has the ability to travel between planes,
it cannot do so for 10 rounds (1 minute). If the cleric has twice
as many levels (or more) as the outsider has effective Hit Dice,
he destroys any outsiders that he would normally banish.</p>
<p>If the cleric would normally turn or destroy undead, he has
the ability to banish or destroy evil outsiders (that is,
outsiders with the <a href="../../monsters/monsterTypes.html#evil">evil subtype</a>). Characters who would
normally rebuke or command undead instead gain the ability to
banish or destroy good outsiders. As an additional option, the
game master might allow clerics worshiping a lawful deity to
banish or destroy chaotic outsiders, while clerics worshiping a
chaotic deity could banish or destroy lawful outsiders. This
ability would replace the ability to banish or destroy good or
evil outsiders.</p>
<p>If you use this variant, consider allowing clerics who can
turn or rebuke <a href="../../monsters/monsterTypes.html#elemental">elementals</a> (that is, clerics
with access to the Air, Earth, Fire, or Water domains) to instead
banish elementals of the same element and banish or destroy
elementals of the opposing element.</p>
<p>This variant is otherwise identical to turning undead,
including limits of daily uses and feats that enhance a cleric's
turning ability.</p>
<a id="planar-cleric" name="planar-cleric"></a>
<img src="../../resource/images/classes/vPlHcleric.jpg" class="wrap" />
<h4>Planar Cleric</h4>
<p>Clerics who focus on the planes trade their ability to turn
undead for control over extraplanar creatures. Outsiders
view skilled planar clerics with awe or fear.</p>
<p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>
<h5>Requirements</h5>
<p>To take a cleric planar substitution level, a character must be
about to take his 4th, 7th, or 11th level of cleric.</p>
<p>The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:</p>
<p>* Have 1 rank in Knowledge (the planes).</p>
<p>* Have a heritage feat.</p>
<p>* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.</p>
<p>* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.</p>
<h5>Class Skills</h5>
<p>Cleric planar substitution levels have the class skills of the
standard cleric class.</p>
<p><b>Skill Points at Each Level</b>: 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<h5>Class Features</h5>
<p>All of the following are features of the cleric's
planar substitution levels.</p>
<p><b>Planar Dismissal (Su)</b>: By selecting
this planar substitution benefit at 4th
level, a cleric trades away some of his
power over undead creatures to gain the
ability to dismiss a summoned extraplanar
creature (such as a fiendish
wolf brought by a summon monster
II spell) by channeling the
power of his faith through his
holy (or unholy) symbol.</p>
<p>To attempt this, the cleric
spends a turn/rebuke attempt
and makes a level check (1d20
+ cleric level) against a DC of
11 + the caster level of the summoner.
If the summoning creature
doesn't have a caster level, use
its Hit Dice instead. The cleric gets
a +2 bonus on this check if the summoned
creature's alignment has at
least one component opposed to his
own (for instance, a lawful good cleric
gets a +2 bonus if the creature's alignment includes either
the chaotic or evil component, while a lawful neutral cleric
gains the bonus only against chaotic summoned creatures.)
Success indicates that the summoned creature is returned
to its home plane.</p>
<p>Each attempt affects only a single creature, chosen by the
cleric, that is within 60 feet and visible to the cleric. A cleric
can't dismiss a summoned creature whose Hit Dice exceed
his caster level + his Cha modifier.</p>
<p>A cleric who selects this planar substitution benefit
reduces his cleric level by three for the purpose of turning
undead. For example, a 4th-level cleric with the planar dismissal
ability turns undead as a 1st-level cleric.</p>
<p><b>Planar Domain</b>: A 7th-level cleric whose alignment is
other than neutral can give up the two domains that he
gained as a 1st-level cleric in exchange for a planar domain
that matches his alignment (see Table: Planar Domains).
The cleric need not worship a deity listed as one of the
typical deities for the domain. A neutral cleric can't select a
planar domain.</p>
<p>The cleric immediately loses the granted powers of
his exchanged domains. Skills that were treated as class
skills due to a granted power are treated as cross-class
skills for this and all future cleric class levels (though
the cleric doesn't lose any skill ranks for skill points
already spent from previous levels). He can no longer
fill domain spell slots with domain spells from the
exchanged domains.</p>
<p>In return, the cleric gains a planar domain that matches
his alignment, gains its granted power, and from now on
may fill his domain spell slots with the spells appropriate to
that domain.</p>

<p><b>Planar Banishment (Su)</b>: By selecting this planar
substitution benefit at 11th level, a cleric trades away his
ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells of 6th level
or higher in order to gain the ability to banish extraplanar
creatures from his home plane. The cleric can "lose" any
prepared spell of 6th level or higher that is not a domain
spell in order to cast banishment. (If the cleric loses a spell of
7th level or higher, calculate the save DC as if the banishment
spell had been heightened to that level.)</p>

<a id="pool-of-healing" name="pool-of-healing"></a>
<h4>Pool of Healing</h4>
<p>By sacrificing some of your personal power, you permanently
establish a link to the Positive Energy Plane through your
deity or belief system. The energy you draw from that plane
obeys your direct command, and you can dispense it in the
form of healing with a simple touch.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 7th.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: To select this class feature, you must permanently
sacrifice one of your 4th-level spell slots.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You establish a pool of positive energy that
you can use to heal yourself or others. This pool contains
enough positive energy to heal an amount of damage equal
to 5 x (1 + your divine caster level) hit points per day. As
a standard action, you can dole it
out with a touch, expending as much or as little
of the pool at a time as you wish in much the same way
as a paladin does with her lay on hands ability. The pool
automatically replenishes every time you prepare spells
for the day.</p>
<p>You can also deal out this positive energy with a melee
touch attack against any creature vulnerable to positive
energy (such as undead), damaging it as if you had cast a cure
spell upon it.</p>
<p>For example, Jozan, a 7th-level cleric of Pelor, gives up one of
his 4th-level spell slots to set up his pool of healing. Every
day, he can heal up to 5 x (1 + 7) = 40 points of damage, or
deal that amount of damage to creatures powered by negative
energy, or use the energy for a combination of those effects,
up to the maximum available. At 10th level, he can heal up
to 55 points of damage using this ability.</p>
<p>Pool of healing is a spell-like ability.</p>
<a id="positive-healing" name="positive-healing"></a>
<h4>Positive Healing</h4>
<p>By imparting a portion of the
divine energies he commands
into an ally, the lightbringer
cleric sustains his friend against
injuries.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.
<p><b>Replaces</b>: One domain granted power.
<p><b>Benefit</b>: A lightbringer cleric
can use one of his turn undead
uses for the day to internalize
the influx of positive energy
and so gains fast healing 2 for
5 rounds. This is a supernatural
ability.</p>
<a id="purple-staff-cleric" name="purple-staff-cleric"></a>
<h4>Purple Staff Cleric</h4>
<p>The Followers of the Purple Staff are a group of divine spellcasters
trying to create a benign theocracy in the eastern part of the
Dragon Coast. These clerics carry a great deal of political power
within the borders of the so-called "Holy Realm" and use their
magic to aid the citizens of their new land.</p>
<p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>
<h5>Requirements</h5>
<p>To take a Purple Staff substitution level, a character must have
Chauntea, Helm, Lathander, Nobanion,
Selune, or Sune as his patron deity, be a member of the Fellowship of the Purple Staff,
have 1 rank in <a href="../../skills/skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (religion), and
be about to take his 4th, 6th, or 9th
level of cleric.</p>
<h5>Class Skills</h5>

<h5>Class Features</h5>
<p>All of the following are features of the
Purple Staff substitution levels.</p>
<p><b>Spontaneous Faith Healing (Su)</b>: At
4th level, a Purple Staff cleric gains the
ability to spontaneously convert prepared
cleric spells of 1st level or higher to cast
faith healing in the same way she can
convert them to cure spells. Armed with
this power, a Purple Staff cleric is easily
able to deal with even the most severe
injuries that common folk might suffer.</p>
<p>This class feature replaces the 2nd-level
spell slot gained by a standard cleric at
4th level. From this point forward, a
Purple Staff cleric has one less 2nd-level
spell slot than normal.</p>
<p><b>Imbue with Spell Ability (Sp)</b>: At 6th level, a Purple Staff
cleric can use an imbue with spell ability effect to imbue a
creature with a single 0- or 1st-level spell she has prepared.
She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to
one-half her class level. With this power, an adventuring Purple
Staff cleric can leave nonspellcaster lieutenants in town to act
on her behalf in emergencies or to spread out her spells to
help defend a larger area (though she is not limited to these
purposes, of course).</p>
<p>This class feature replaces the 3rd-level spell slot gained by a
standard cleric at 6th level. From this point forward, a Purple
Staff cleric has one less 3rd-level spell slot than normal.</p>
<p><b>Turn Invader (Su)</b>: At 9th level, a Purple Staff cleric is so
devoted to protecting his homeland that he can use his ability
to turn undead to frighten enemies of the Holy Realm. When
standing within the borders of his country, he can turn hostile
monsters or enemies of the Holy Realm as a good-aligned cleric
turns undead. He cannot destroy such creatures outright using
this ability.</p>
<a id="rage-cleric" name="rage-cleric"></a>
<h4>Rage Cleric</h4>
<p>The deities of the core D&D pantheon span the spectrum of both
alignment and temperament. Their clerics display equal variety
when it comes to domain spells, customs, and codes of conduct.
Why should a cleric of a wild warrior deity like Gruumsh or
Kord equip himself in heavy armor, or even learn its use, when
his barbaric flock enters battle with only fury and courage
for protection?</p>
<p>The archetypical D&D cleric, with his mace and full plate
displayed as prominently as his holy symbol, is as much a
warrior as a spellcaster. In a similar vein, the rage cleric
presents his divinely-inspired fighting arts just as proudly,
although they take a very different form.</p>
<p>A rage cleric has the barbarian's rage ability. Although this
greatly increases his melee prowess, it also limits his
spellcasting ability in the heat of combat. The rage cleric's
lower base attack bonus and d8 Hit Dice make him a far less
effective frontline fighter than a barbarian, but if he
prepares himself with spells beforehand he becomes a
formidable berserker.</p>
<p>Most rage clerics follow deities who grant access to the
Chaos, Strength, and War domains. On rare occasions, neutral
clerics of lawful war deities adopt this class, but such wild
warrior-priests walk a fine line between losing their deities'
favor and capitalizing on their signature ability.</p>
<p>Rage clerics often begin their careers as barbarians, but at
some point they experience a spiritual awakening that leads
them down the path of the faithful.</p>
<p>Humans, dwarves, and half-orcs make up the majority of rage
clerics. Elves, although chaotically inclined, usually lack
the inner ferocity necessary to turn that chaos into a
barbaric rage. Orc clerics, on the other hand, almost always
adopt this variant class, which personifies the will of their
barbaric deities. Many savage humanoids and lesser giants also
favor it.</p>
<p>The rage cleric is a variant cleric. Unless otherwise noted, a
rage cleric advances in the same manner as a cleric (same Hit
Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points,
and so on). When a character elects to take a level of cleric
or rage cleric, he may not later take levels in the other
class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits
of a 1st-level cleric twice.</p>
<p><b>Alignment</b>: A rage cleric cannot be lawful but must still be
within one step of his deity's alignment.</p>
<h5>Class Features</h5>
<p>All of the following are features of the
rage cleric class.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A rage cleric is proficient with
all simple weapons, light armor, and shields (except tower
shields).</p>
<p><b>Rage</b>: A rage cleric rages as a barbarian of equal level and
gains the greater rage, indomitable will, tireless rage, and
mighty rage class features as he progresses. Rage cleric and
barbarian levels stack for the purposes of determining the
number of times per day a character can enter a rage and the
type of rage variant available.</p>
<p>In exchange, a rage cleric loses his ability to turn or rebuke
undead as well as his ability to gain domains (which includes
domain granted powers and domain spells).</p>
<h5>Ex-Rage Clerics</h5>
<p>A rage cleric who becomes lawful loses his rage abilities.
However, provided that his deity accepts lawful-aligned
clerics, he can continue to advance in this class and gain
spells.</p>
<p>A rage cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct
required by his deity (generally by acting in a manner
contrary to the deity's alignment or purposes) loses all
spells and class features, except for rage and proficiency
with light armor and simple weapons. He cannot continue to
advance in this class until he atones (see the <a href="../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#atonement">atonement</a>
spell).</p>
<a id="raptoran-cleric" name="raptoran-cleric"></a>
<h4>Raptoran Cleric</h4>
<p>The raptoran cleric gains extra powers from his dedication
to the pact made between his race and the denizens of the
Elemental Plane of Air. While not as combat-oriented as a
typical cleric, a raptoran cleric can bring powerful servants
of air to do his bidding.</p>
<p><b>Hit Die</b>: d6.</p>
<h5>Requirements</h5>
<p>To take a raptoran cleric substitution level, a character
must be a raptoran about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 7th level
of cleric. A raptoran cleric must have selected either the
<a href="../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/domains.html#air">Air domain</a> or the
<a href="../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/domains.html#sky">Sky domain</a> to select a raptoran
cleric substitution level.</p>
<h5>Class Skills</h5>
<p>Raptoran cleric substitution levels grant the same class skills
as the standard cleric class.</p>
<p><b>Skill Points at Each Level</b>: 2 + Int modifier (or four times
this number as a beginning character).</p>

<h5>Class Features</h5>
<p>All the following are features of the raptoran cleric's racial
substitution levels.</p>
<p><b>Air Mastery (Ex)</b>: Beginning at 1st level, airborne creatures
take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a
raptoran cleric.</p>
<p>This substitution feature replaces the standard cleric's
heavy armor proficiency gained at 1st level.</p>
<p><b>Empathy of the Winds (Ex)</b>: A 1st-level raptoran cleric
gains a strong bond with air and its denizens. He learns
Auran as a bonus language (in addition to the languages
available to him because of his race and the Speak Language
skill). He gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy
checks made to interact with natives of the Elemental Plane
of Air. If he has the ability to bolster air creatures (such
as from the Air domain), he gains a +4 bonus on turning
checks made to do so. Allied air elementals within 60 feet
of the cleric gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and
damage rolls.</p>
<p><b>Air Summoning Talent (Ex)</b>: Beginning at 3rd level, a
raptoran cleric can summon certain creatures of air more
easily than other clerics can. Add the following monsters
to the list of creatures that the cleric can summon with the
appropriate summon monster spell:</p>
<p><i>Summon monster II</i>: Small air elemental</p>
<p><i>Summon monster III</i>: Air mephit</p>
<p><i>Summon monster IV</i>: Medium air elemental</p>
<p><i>Summon monster V</i>: Large air elemental</p>
<p><i>Summon monster VI</i>: Huge air elemental</p>
<p><i>Summon monster VII</i>: Greater air elemental</p>
<p><i>Summon monster VIII</i>: Elder air elemental</p>
<p>This substitution feature removes all spells with the earth
descriptor from the standard cleric's spell list. If a spell
would only have the earth descriptor due to a particular
version of the spell (such as a summon monster spell used
to summon an earth elemental), the spell remains on the
cleric's spell list but the version with the earth descriptor
cannot be cast.</p>
<p><b>Open the Wind-Gate (Ex)</b>: A 7th-level raptoran cleric can
use the planar ally spells to call a more powerful air elemental
than would normally be allowed. The cleric can call an 8 HD
Large air elemental with lesser planar ally, a single 16 HD Huge
air elemental (or two 8 HD Large air elementals) with planar
ally, or a single 24 HD elder air elemental (or multiple Large
and/or Huge air elementals totaling 24 HD) with greater
planar ally.</p>
<p>The costs associated with these spells remain the same.
However, if any of the called air elementals die while in the
service of the cleric, the cleric loses access to this ability for
seven days and takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and
checks during that period.</p>
<p>This substitution feature replaces the standard cleric's
ability to call creatures other than air elementals with the
various planar ally spells.</p>
<a id="rebuke-dragons" name="rebuke-dragons"></a>
<h4>Rebuke Dragons</h4>
<p>Though the destruction (or control) of undead is common to
many divinely oriented characters, the deities also recognize
the ancient power of the dragons as a primal force. Some
reward their followers with the ability to instill such creatures
with awe or command them as minions.</p>
<p><b>Class</b>: Cleric or paladin.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st (cleric) or 4th (paladin).</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: If you select this class feature, you do not gain
the ability to turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You channel divine energy to rebuke (awe) or
command (control) dragons. This ability functions as an evil
cleric rebuking undead.</p>
<p>It is more difficult to rebuke or command dragons that
share your moral or ethical bent. Any dragon that shares
one alignment component with you is treated as having turn
resistance +2 against this ability. Any dragon that shares both
alignment components with you is treated as having turn
resistance +4 against this ability.</p>
<p>You can also use this ability to bolster a dragon against an
attempt by another creature to use its own rebuke dragons
ability (the same way an evil cleric can bolster undead against
turning). To bolster a dragon, you must share at least one
alignment component with the dragon.</p>
<p>An attempt to rebuke dragons counts as an attempt to turn
or rebuke undead for the purpose of qualifying for or activating
divine feats, or for using other abilities that require you
to expend a use of your turn or rebuke ability.</p>
<a id="spontaneous-domain-casting" name="spontaneous-domain-casting"></a>
<img src="../../resource/images/classes/vPHB2cleric.jpg" class="wrap" />
<h4>Spontaneous Domain Casting</h4>
<p>After a while, clerics can start looking very similar. Even with a
variety of domains to choose from, domain spells take up such
a small portion of the average cleric's repertoire that they don't
have much effect on the overall feel of the character. With spontaneous
domain casting, though, your domain choice becomes
a more important element of your character. You won't be able
to provide as much healing to your party as a typical cleric, but
the ability to prepare cure or inflict spells in your domain spell
slots keeps you from falling too far behind in that area.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: If you select this class feature, you do not gain
the ability to spontaneously convert prepared spells into cure
or inflict spells.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: You can convert stored spell energy into the spells
of one of your domains. Pick one of your two domains. You can
"lose" any prepared spell (other than a domain spell) to cast any
spell of the same level or lower on that domain list. Your choice
is permanent unless an alignment change, deity change, or other
dramatic event leaves you incapable of accessing the domain.</p>
<p>In addition, when preparing spells you can choose to fill
any or all of your domain spell slots with either cure or inflict
spells (depending on whether you would normally convert
prepared spells to cure or inflict spells) of the same level.</p>
<p>For example, Crucius is a cleric of Heironeous with the Good
and War domains. At 1st level, he chooses to spontaneously
cast War domain spells. Thereafter, he can lose a prepared
1st-level spell to cast magic weapon, a prepared 2nd-level spell
to cast spiritual weapon (or magic weapon), and so on. Furthermore,
in each domain spell slot he can prepare a spell from
the Good domain, a spell from the War domain, or a cure spell
of the same level.</p>

<h4>True Daylight</h4>
<p>Lightbringer clerics,
as befits their name,
are capable of channeling
divine energy
in the form of pure
sunlight.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: 1st.</p>
<p><b>Replaces</b>: One domain granted power.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: A lightbringer
cleric can use up one of his
turn undead uses for the day
to empower a daylight spell he
casts with positive energy. The
resulting daylight effect has a
smaller radiance radius and a
shorter, inconstant duration;
however, the daylight created
is the equivalent of daylight
for the purpose of its effect on
creatures that are damaged or
destroyed by bright light (such
as vampires).</p>
<p>The effect created by this ability
sheds true daylight in a 10-foot
radius and has a duration of 1d4
rounds (roll to determine each
time this ability is used). This is
an extraordinary ability.</p>
<h4><a id="turning-presence" name="turning-presence"></a>Turning Presence</h4>
<p>The standard rules for <a href="../../basic/specialAttacks.html#turn">turning</a> undead
allow a cleric to affect a relatively narrow band of undead (up to 4 HD greater than his
cleric level). This makes many undead creatures "off limits" for
this iconic power of the cleric. This variant changes the
cleric's turning check into a battle of personality strength,
representing it by a level check that also takes into account the
opponents' Charisma scores.</p>
<p>When turning undead using this variant, the cleric makes a
turning check against the closest creature first, followed by a
separate check against the next closest, and so on. When two or
more creatures are equally close, the creature with the lowest
number of Hit Dice is affected first (if it's still a tie, the
character chooses which is affected first). Creatures more than
60 feet away cannot be turned.</p>
<p>A turning check is a level check to which the character also
adds his Charisma modifier. (Use the character's effective
turning level, which is equal to class level for a cleric or
class level -3 for a paladin.) The DC is 10 + the creature's Hit
Dice + its turn resistance (if any) + its Charisma modifier. (To
speed play, the game master can add a "Turn DC" score to the
statistics block of each undead creature.)</p>
<p>If you use this variant, some creatures' turn resistance
should be increased to keep them from being too easy to turn. Any
creature with turn resistance of +4 or higher should gain an
additional +2 to its turn resistance. Creatures with turn
resistance of +3 or lower need no change.</p>
<p>If the check fails, the creature is unaffected. Its Hit Dice
do not count against the total number of creatures the character
can turn (see below).</p>
<p>If the character succeeds on the check, the affected creature
stands frozen in place for 1 round, just as if it
were <a href="../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#paralyzed">paralyzed</a> (though
this affects even creatures with immunity to paralysis). On each
succeeding turn, the character may take a standard action to
concentrate on the effect, prolonging the effective paralysis for
an additional round. (This doesn't count as a turn attempt, and
affects all undead creatures that the character has "paralyzed"
in this manner.) The character may concentrate on this effect for
a maximum of 10 consecutive rounds, after which the undead
creature can act normally. If a creature affected in this way is
attacked or takes damage, the effect is broken and the creature
may act normally beginning on its next turn. (The character's
proximity to the creature has no effect.) This effect is the same
whether the character channels positive or negative energy.</p>
<p>If the character's check beats the DC by 5 or more, he may
instead turn the creature (if he channels positive energy) or
rebuke it (if he channels negative energy).</p>
<p>If the creature has Hit Dice equal to one-half the character's
effective cleric level or less, the turning attempt automatically
succeeds, and he does not have to make a check (the creature's
Hit Dice still count against the maximum). Furthermore, such
undead are automatically destroyed (if the character channels
positive energy) or commanded (if he channels negative
energy).</p>
<p>The character makes checks against each eligible creature
until he has affected the maximum Hit Dice worth of creatures, or
there are no more eligible creatures. He can affect a number of
Hit Dice of creatures equal to three &times; his effective cleric
level on any one turning attempt. For example, a 4th-level cleric
(or 7th-level paladin) can affect up to 12 HD worth of creatures,
which could mean two creatures with 6 HD each, four creatures
with 3 HD each, or any other combination that adds up to 12
HD.</p>
<p>An evil cleric can instead channel negative energy to bolster
undead or to dispel a turning effect. In either case, the cleric
makes a normal turning check (if attempting to dispel a turning
effect, add the turning cleric's Charisma modifier to the DC of
the evil cleric's turning check. if the cleric successfully
rebukes the undead, the undead gain turn resistance +2 (if he was
attempting to bolster them) or are no longer turned (if he was
attempting to dispel the turning effect).</p>
<p>For example, a 3rd-level cleric, faces
three <a href="../../monsters/monsters/core/monstersG.html#ghoul">ghouls</a> and a
ghast. The cleric can turn up to 9 HD of creatures. Two of the
ghouls are 10 feet and 15 feet away, respectively. The third
ghoul and the ghast are both 20 feet away. His turning attempts
affect the closest ghouls first, then the farthest ghoul, and
then the ghast. The cleric makes the first turning check. A ghoul
has 2 HD, but it also has +2 turn resistance, so it is treated as
a 4 HD creature. After adding the ghoul's +1 Charisma modifier,
the turning check DC is 15. The cleric rolls a 12, which, with
his three cleric levels and +1 Charisma modifier, gives him a
result of 16, so the nearest ghoul is halted in place. (If the
cleric wants to maintain the effect, he'll have to continue to
concentrate on it in later rounds.) He has successfully turned 4
HD worth of creatures, leaving him with 5 HD. This is enough to
affect another ghoul, so he makes another turning check against
the next closest ghoul. the cleric rolls a 6 against the second
ghoul, for a result of 10, so the ghoul is unaffected. Against
the third ghoul, his roll is 16 for a result of 20, which beats
the DC by at least 5, so the cleric can turn the ghoul if he
wishes to do so. Since he knows he can't affect the ghast on this
turning attempt&mdash;it has 4 HD and 2 turn resistance, and the
cleric has only 1 HD of turning left &mdash; he chooses to
paralyze the third ghoul rather than sending it scurrying back
into its burrow where it can gather more allies. (Even if the
cleric had failed to affect the third ghoul, he would only have 5
HD left &mdash; not enough to affect the ghast thanks to its +2
turn resistance.) On his next turn, the cleric can choose to
continue holding the ghouls in place or, if his allies have
already destroyed the three ghouls, use another turning attempt
against the ghast (which requires a DC 19 turning check).</p>
